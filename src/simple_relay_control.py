Rapid Relay Controller for Sequent Microsystems 8RELIND Board
===========================================================
Simply press keys 1-8 to activate the corresponding relay.
Press * to activate all relays simultaneously.
Press m for a musical easter egg.
Press b for Beauty and the Beast pattern.
The relay will rapidly toggle on/off for 5 seconds.
