# Beauty and the Beast Rose Petal Controller

## What is this thing?
Its for a Beaty and the beast play for my mom so hi mom!
I hope everything works first try but if it doesnt read this 

## Setting up for the first time
1. Plug the Raspberry Pi into power
2. Connect a keyboard and monitor 
3. Wait for it to start up
4. Click the "Rose Petal Controller" icon on the screen

## Two ways to control the petals:

### Method 1: From your phone/laptop (normal way)
1. Pick "Web Controller" on the first screen
2. Type in the IP address (ask your director for this number)
3. Hit "Connect"
4. Press "Drop Next Petal" button each time you need a petal to fall
5. After all petals drop, use "Reset" button to start over

### Method 2: Using a keyboard (backup way)
If the network isn't working or you can't connect remotely:
1. Choose "Keyboard Mode" on the first screen
2. Press "Run Setup" (just needed once)
3. Click "Activate Keyboard Mode"
4. Press X to drop a petal
5. Press R to reset when all petals are gone

## Help! Something's not working
- Check all the power cables are plugged in
- Make sure everything is turned on
- If you can't connect remotely, just use keyboard mode
- Still stuck? Call me I can help or ask the internet or something haha

Remember: Keyboard mode is your backup plan - use it if the network fails!
